title: Mentors
---

If you are a developer that likes teaching, you are a kindred spirit. Welcome!

### Becoming a mentor

Please come to [Sydney Ruby on Rails Development Hub](http://www.reinteractive.net/community/development_hub) and volunteer to teach. No preparation is needed.

Hopefully in future microcourses will be held at other community events like Rails Girls and Rails Camp.

### Holding a microcourse

The idea is that at events like Rails Camp, InstallFest, Development Hub and Rails Girls, a developer such as yourself would use the content here to teach 1-3 students.

You could run a *microcourse* or hold a *microcourses session*. People could choose which course they want to take or teach and group up. There could be several microcourses going on at the same time.

Both mentors and students should be able to turn up with no preparation and be involved.

### I'd like to be involved in this project

Great! Fork [the project on GitHub](<%= data.project.repo %>) and write a course, we love pull requests. Or create an issue in the issue tracking system there, or just drop us a line.
