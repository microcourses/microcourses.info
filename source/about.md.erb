At [Rails Camp Sydney](https://twitter.com/railscamp_au), November 2013, [@gregmcintyre](https://twitter.com/gregmcintyre) initiated a discussion regarding how to help newcomers get more out of Rails Camp. Inspired by that discussion, [@joshuapaling](https://twitter.com/joshuapaling) wrote [a blog post](http://joshuapaling.com/post/rails-camp-micro-courses) about the idea of MicroCourses.

This project is still young. You can read lots more on the [ReadMe of the GitHub project](https://github.com/puyo/microcourses). We welcome contributions, and we'll get everything more organised soon!
