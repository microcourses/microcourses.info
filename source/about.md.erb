At [Rails Camp Sydney](https://twitter.com/railscamp_au) November 2013, [@gregmcintyre](https://twitter.com/gregmcintyre) initiated a discussion regarding how to help newcomers get more out of Rails Camp. Inspired by that discussion, [@joshuapaling](https://twitter.com/joshuapaling) wrote [a blog post](http://joshuapaling.com/post/rails-camp-micro-courses) about the idea of microcourses.

Since then we have attracted a lot of interest and had many discussions about the idea with the fabulous members of the Sydney Rails community.

This project is young. You can read lots more on the [README file of the GitHub project](<%= data.project.repo %>). We welcome contributions, and we'll get everything more organised soon!
