### What is a microcourse?

A **microcourse** is a 1-2 hour computer programming course involving a mentor and one or two students, with a tight focus on one topic that is of specific interest or value to the students.

The resources available here are **for mentors**. They are designed for printing and photocopying so that they can be conveniently stored and used at programming related events (such as Rails Girls and Rails Camp) and passed on by one student to another, with minimal preparation time.

These microcourses are intended to complement university education, online courses, commercial courses, industry training and self study, by facilitating and encouraging **fun and productive mentoring**.

We believe that mentoring relationships can set students in the right direction, bridge gaps in educational offerings, and fill or consolidate areas of knowledge for programmers, whether they are experienced or not.

### History

At [Rails Camp Sydney](https://twitter.com/railscamp_au) November 2013, [@gregmcintyre](https://twitter.com/gregmcintyre) initiated a discussion regarding how to help newcomers get more out of Rails Camp. Inspired by that discussion, [@joshuapaling](https://twitter.com/joshuapaling) wrote [a blog post](http://joshuapaling.com/post/rails-camp-micro-courses) about the idea of microcourses.

Since then we have attracted a lot of interest and had many discussions about the idea with the fabulous members of the Sydney Rails community.

This project is young. You can read lots more on the [README file of the GitHub project](<%= data.project.repo %>). We welcome contributions, and we'll get everything more organised soon!
