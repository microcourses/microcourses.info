A **microcourse** is a 1-2 hour computer programming course involving a mentor and
one or two students, with a tight focus on one topic that is of specific interest
or value to the students.

The resources available here are **for mentors**. They are designed for
printing and photocopying so that they can be conveniently stored and used at
programming related events (such as RailsGirls and RailsCamp) and passed on by
one student to another, with minimal preparation time.

These microcourses are intended to complement university education, online
courses, commercial courses, industry training and self study, by facilitating
and encouraging **fun and productive mentoring**.

We believe that mentoring relationships can set students in the right
direction, bridge gaps in educational offerings, and fill or consolidate areas
of knowledge for programmers, whether they are experienced or not.
