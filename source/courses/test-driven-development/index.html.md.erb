This course was originally prepared by [Greg McIntyre](https://twitter.com/gregmcintyre) for the Rails Girls Next workshop at Ruby Conf 2014.

## Goal

You will be writing a Roman Numeral converter, and sticking to the principles of Test Driven Development (TDD). This is intended as an exercise to teach you what we're talking about when we say Test Driven Development. It also involves pair programming - but don't worry, if you don't have a pair, you can still do the course!
