* Tools like Make are designed to save you time by **only compiling the files
  that changed**.
* They are called **dependency build tools** because they achieve this by
  tracking which files depend on which files.
* They can also run jobs on multiple CPU cores to speed things up.

Create the following files:

<%= file('Makefile', 'make') %>

This cryptic command links several compiled C modules together into an
executable. Note that the second line in this file may need to be indented with
a tab character, not spaces.

<%= file('main.c', 'c') %>
<%= file('file_format.h', 'c') %>
<%= file('file_format.c', 'c') %>

Now at the command prompt you can build and run the project like so:

```
make && ./word
```

Try re-running the command, editing different files, and re-running the
command above. Pay attention to which files are built each time.
