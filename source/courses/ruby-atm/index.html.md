This course was originally prepared by [Joss Paling](https://twitter.com/joshuapaling) for the Rails Girls Next workshop at Ruby Conf 2014.

## Goal

In this course, we'll be writing a function to handle withdrawing money from an ATM. It will accept an amount, and return either an array representing the notes to return, or false if that amount cannot be made up of the available notes.
