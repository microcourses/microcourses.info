This course was originally prepared by [Tim McEwan](https://github.com/tjmcewan) for the Rails Girls Next workshop at Ruby Conf 2014.

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to create a coffee listing application without the magic of Rails. You will hopefully gain a greater understanding of the underlying principles involved in programming web applications, and gain a greater appreciation for some of the things Rails does for you.
