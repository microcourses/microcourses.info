### Running a microcourse

Are you are a developer that likes teaching? You are a kindred spirit. Welcome!

We'll be running our experiments at [Sydney Ruby on Rails Development Hub](http://www.reinteractive.net/community/development_hub), so if you'd like to come along and participate, please do. No preparation is needed.

If you don't live in Sydney, please run a microcourse and send us feedback.

#### Advice for running a microcourse

* Use the student's computer.
* Let the student do all the typing, even to configure or install software.
* Set aside 2 hours, more if you think your student might need to install software.
* Ask the student for 5 minutes so you can read over the material. You should not need any other preparation. Ensure you feel comfortable with the material.
* If you are not familiar with the student, ask if they have programmed before. If so, what languages?
* Close the computer or move away from it to begin with. Describe the concepts involved and draw any pictures you feel would help, preferably into the student's notebook. Try to get the student clear about what the goal is and what the algorithm or approach will be.
* If it seems too *easy*, just finish early and then challenge your student with the supplied challenge or one that either your student or yourself comes up with.
* If it seems too *hard*, take a break. You have several options:
  * Consider whether going back to pen and paper for a little would get the student unstuck.
  * Consider cutting the session short and selecting a different microcourse before coming back to this one.
  * Consider that the course material itself may not be ideal, and send us feedback or pull requests to improve it.
