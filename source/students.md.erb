So, you want to learn more about Ruby and Rails? Welcome!

### Who are these resources for?

The resources on this site are *not do-it-yourself courses*. They're intended as guides for mentors to hold one-to-one sessions with students.

### How do I take a microcourse?

Come along to the free monthly [Sydney Ruby on Rails Development Hub](http://www.reinteractive.net/community/development_hub) and ask one of us to take you through a course. This project is still young, and we're just starting to develop courses. We'd love you to try out a course and give us feedback.

### I'm not in Sydney! :-(

We recommend that you *show this site to an experienced developer* and ask them nicely.

As we get more organised and develop more material, we would love to visit and teach at a Ruby, Rails or web related event near you.

### I'd like to get involved

Great! You don't have to be experienced with Ruby to help out. Newcomers can help by giving us ideas for topics they find confusing, and by taking a course and giving us feedback on what worked, what didn't, and how to improve.
