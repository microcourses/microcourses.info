### Taking a microcourse

Come along to the free monthly [Sydney Ruby on Rails Development Hub](http://www.reinteractive.net/community/development_hub) and ask one of us to take you through a course. This project is still young, and we're just starting to develop courses. We'd love you to try out a course and give us feedback.

Not in Sydney? We recommend that you show this site to an experienced developer and politely ask them to teach you.

The resources on this site are not intended as do-it-yourself courses. They are guides and materials for mentors to hold one-to-one sessions with students. You are welcome to use these materials however you like, but please be aware that it will take a lot longer than the suggested time on each course, and that it will feel like something is missing because they rely on the mentor to provide guidance and explanations.

### Get involved

We need beginners! Beginners help us by giving us ideas for topics they find confusing, and by working with us to learn the content so that we get experience with what worked, what didn't, and how to improve the content here.

Also keep in mind, the best mentors are people only slightly more advanced than the student. Consider teaching a microcourse to a peer or an even less experienced student.

There are feedback links and forms throughout this website. Please use them! :)
